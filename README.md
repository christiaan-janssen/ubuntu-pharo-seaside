# Ubuntu Pharo Seaside Docker image

I was trying some Seaside / Pharo development and wanted to run the results on my docker server. I found an image [Geoffroy Couprie](https://github.com/Geal/archlinux-pharo-image) based of of Arch. It looked ok, but some how it is using up a whole CPU core on my docker server.

This image is using Pharo Smalltalk and Seaside
